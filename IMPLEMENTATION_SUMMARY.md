## Files Modified

### 1. `battle.py`
**Changes**:
- Modified `SelectingCommands` state to wait for UI input
- Added `action_selected` flag to signal when player has made a choice
- Removed automatic behavior execution for player-controlled characters

**Before**:
```python
class SelectingCommands(BattleState):
    def __init__(self, actor: Character) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.actor = actor

    def loop(self, battle: Battle, dt: float) -> None:
        self.actor.behaviour.execute(self.actor, battle)
        battle.state = CheckingDeath()
```

**After**:
```python
class SelectingCommands(BattleState):
    def __init__(self, actor: Character) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.actor = actor
        self.action_selected = False

    def loop(self, battle: Battle, dt: float) -> None:
        if self.action_selected:
            battle.state = CheckingDeath()
```

### 2. `game.py`
**Changes**:
- Complete rewrite to integrate UI system
- Added battle initialization and management
- Added input handling for menu navigation
- Added battle state rendering
- Added victory/defeat handling
- Added restart/quit functionality
- Created main() function with demo battle

**New Methods**:
- `start_battle()`: Initialize battle with UI
- `update_battle()`: Update battle logic each frame
- `handle_battle_input()`: Process keyboard input during battle
- `draw_battle()`: Render the complete battle UI

## Integration Architecture

### Input Flow
```
User Input (Keyboard)
    ↓
pygame.event.get()
    ↓
game.handle_battle_input(event)
    ↓
battle_ui.handle_input(event, actor)
    ↓
[Navigate menus / Select items]
    ↓
[Action complete?] → Yes
    ↓
battle_ui.execute_selected_action(actor)
    ↓
action.execute(actor, targets, battle)
    ↓
battle.state.action_selected = True
    ↓
Battle state advances
```

### State Machine Integration
```
Waiting
    ↓
SpeedTie (if needed)
    ↓
PrepareActor
    ↓
ControlledTurn
    ↓
SelectingCommands ← UI takes control here
    ↓              ← Waits for action_selected flag
CheckingDeath
    ↓
EndingTurn
    ↓
Back to Waiting
```
