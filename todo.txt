Inventory should belong to each actor rather than battle. In preparation,
    set each actor to have their inventory reference the same Inventory object
    which belongs to the player/savefile. Enemy inventories can be set when
    defining. Also change the rest of the code to handle inventory as an object
    rather than list.
