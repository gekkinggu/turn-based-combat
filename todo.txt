Menu cancelling
Speed tie functionality
Inventory should belong to each actor rather than battle. In preparation,
    set each actor to have their inventory reference the same Inventory object
    which belongs to the player/savefile. Enemy inventories can be set when
    defining. Also change the rest of the code to handle inventory as an object
    rather than list.
mypy exposed a problem with handle_input may or may not needing an actor
    argument. Refactored this, ended up breaking menu cancelling.

TODO
Make sure of how status effects works. Including costing.
Fix menu cancelling.
